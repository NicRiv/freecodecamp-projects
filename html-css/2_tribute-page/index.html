                    <p>Xul was a painter, sculptor, writer, musician, astrologer, esotericist, and inventor of imaginary languages.</p>
                    <p>He began a long term friendship with Borges, sharing with him many interests and intellectual affinities: Eastern philosophy, literature, religion, mysticism, art and a passion for language. Borges recalled “having spent so many afternoons... in that magnificent library, perhaps one of the best libraries that I have ever seen in my life, with books in all languages”.</p>

                <h2 >Biography</h2>
                <p>Oscar Agustín Alejandro Schulz Solari was born on December 14 —un- der Sagittarius, rising in Pisces—, in the town of San Fernando, Province of Buenos Aires, where he spent his childhood. His parents were Emilio Schulz Riga (Riga, Latvia, 1853 – Buenos Aires, 1925) and Agustina Solari (San Pietro di Roveretto, Italy, 1865 – Buenos Aires, 1958). At the age of seven he caught typhoid fever and the following year his only sister, Sara, died at the age of four from that disease. He went to primary school at the Fermy, a French school, where he studied French, Italian and Latin. In 1900 he was sent to the English School. He began studies in violin but, after suffering a riding accident, gave them up.</p>
                <p>During the years of the war, he struck up what was to be a lifelong friendship with Argentine artist Emilio Pettoruti, then a young man living in Italy and associated with the futurists. Also around that time, he began to pay more attention to painting, first with watercolor (which would always remain his main medium as a painter), although he gradually began working in tempera and – very occasionally — oils. He also adopted the pen-name of Xul Solar. His first major exhibition of his art was in 1920 in Milan, together with sculptor Arturo Martini.</p>
                <p>In 1916, Schulz Solari first signed his work "Xul Solar,” ostensibly for the purposes to simplify the phonetics of his name, but an examination of the adopted name reveals that the first name is the reverse of "lux,” which means "light" in Latin. Combined with "solar", the name reads as "the light of the sun", and demonstrates the artist's affinity for the universal source of light and energy. His father's name "Schulz" and "Xul" are pronounced the same in Spanish.</p>
                <p>During the years that followed he continued his travels, extending his orbit to Munich and Hamburg. In 1924, his work was exhibited in Paris in a show of Latin American artists. He also struck up an acquaintance with British Mage Aleister Crowley and his mistress Leah Hirsig who held high hopes for his discipleship, but later that year he returned to Buenos Aires, where he promptly became associated with the avant garde "Florida group" (a.k.a. "Martín Fierro group"), a circle that also included Jorge Luis Borges, with whom he was to keep an association and close friendship. It was in this group that he also met poet and novelist Leopoldo Marechal who would immortalize him as the astrologer Schultze in his famous novel Adán Buenosayres.</p>
                <p>On April 9 he died in his home in the Tigre. His hands held a rosary of 71 pieces carved out of wood, colored by Xul himself, with the cross of Caravaca, the same he depicted himself with in the work Desarrollo del I Ching, executed in 1953. His wife Lita was with him, according to whom, the artist “did not believe in death, for him there would always be a tomorrow”.</p>

                <h2 >His Paintings</h2>
                <p>Xul Solar's painting is fantastic, rather than surreal, as it is sometimes defined.</p>
                <p>He makes most of his work in small or medium format, using watercolor or tempera, although he also uses oil, experimenting with unconventional supports such as cardboard, wood and glass.</p>
                <p>His first paintings are loaded with symbolism and the drawing is schematic. By 1918, his subject matter began to include architectural motifs and geometric compositions. From 1923, the inclusion of the human figure takes place.</p>

                <h2 >Panchess & Panlengua</h2>
                <p>He continued his research into his new system of spellings. He wrote to Lita, “Keria cuidra”, about his neographies of him and developed the evolution of the strokes between consonants and vowels.</p>
                <p>At the time, Xul re-created the traditional chess game and called it “pan chess, pan game or creole chess”, “a game requiring combinative skills, independent of chance, for a civilization more perfect in the intellectual, the scientific and the aesthetic, which shall create in this peace…”. A constructive game to solve problems of panlengua [Panlanguage], a new universal language with numerical and astrological roots, mono-syllabic, without grammar, i.e., written as it is pronounced.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <q><em>Xul imaginó un idioma, la Panlengua, basado en la astrología. Creía sinceramente en la astrología, lo cual quiere decir que creía en la pluralidad de los astros o de los dioses. Xul me dijo: ‘Qué raro que la gente piense que es mejor creer en un solo Dios. Es un error. Si Dios es bueno, conviene que haya muchos dioses. Cuanto más dioses, mejor’. Y él aceptaba una pluralidad de dioses: por lo pronto, los dioses que corresponden a los planetas, a los días de la semana. El hablaba de Venus y creía que hay una divinidad llamada Venus. A una amiga mía le dijo: ‘Cuando usted sonríe, cuando usted mira, ¿por qué brillan sus ojos? ¿Por qué su sonrisa nos atrae? Porque es Venus la que sonríe’.</em></q>
